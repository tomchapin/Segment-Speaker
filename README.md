# SegmentSpeaker

## Overview

SegmentSpeaker is an open-source project aimed at developing an advanced AI system capable of identifying, separating, and transcribing overlapping speech from multiple speakers in audio data. By harnessing the power of synthetic data generation and open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models, SegmentSpeaker seeks to create a robust model capable of handling complex overlapping speech scenarios.

## Motivation

In many real-world audio applications—such as meetings, interviews, podcasts, and live broadcasts—multiple speakers often talk simultaneously. This overlapping speech presents significant challenges for accurate speech recognition, speaker diarization, and transcription. Existing systems struggle to separate and identify individual speakers in these conditions, leading to errors and misrepresentations.

SegmentSpeaker aims to address this challenge by:

- Leveraging synthetic voices to generate infinite amounts of overlapping speech data.
- Utilizing open-source TTS models to create diverse and realistic synthetic speech.
- Developing a model capable of handling multiple overlapping speakers.
- Combining speech separation, speaker diarization, and automatic speech recognition (ASR) into a unified system.
- Providing tools and resources for the community to advance overlapping speech processing technologies.

## Features

- **Infinite Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools to generate extensive and diverse datasets with overlapping speech using synthetic voices.
- **Integration of Open-Source TTS Models**: Supports multiple TTS engines (e.g., Coqui TTS, VITS, Festival) for speech synthesis.
- **Advanced Model Architectures**: Modular design for speech separation, speaker diarization, and ASR, with the option to combine them into an end-to-end model.
- **Scalable Training and Evaluation Scripts**: Designed to handle large datasets and various model configurations.
- **Experiment Configuration and Management**: Flexible configuration files for reproducible experiments and easy adjustments.
- **Extensive Documentation and Testing**: Comprehensive guides, API references, and a suite of unit tests for reliability and maintainability.
